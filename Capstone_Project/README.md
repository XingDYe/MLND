## Convolutional Neural Networks for Discriminative Localization
Keras implementation of a simple CNNs

This implementation is written in Keras and build a simple convolutional neural network.

### Usage

``` 
python get_cam.py --model_path gap.h5 --image_path images/4.jpg

usage: get_cam.py [-h] [--image_path IMAGE_PATH]
                       [--model_path MODEL_PATH]
          
```
